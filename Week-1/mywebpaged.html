                I have been a member for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day saints for all my life. My favorite Scriputure is Ether 8 26<br>
                Wherefore, I, Moroni, am commanded to write these things that evil may be done away,and that the time may come that Satan may have<br>
                no power upon the hearts of the children of men, but that they may be persuaded to do good continually, that they may come unto the<br>
                fountain of all righteousness and be saved.
